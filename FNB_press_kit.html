                DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT
            </h2>
            <p>
                This film is an homage to the genre, I am very passionate about Noir. From the visuals and the acting, it is to deliver a stirring film. As a filmmaker, representation is important and I hold diversity to a usual standard. On this and previous projects, I have always employed cast and crew, of diverse ethnicity. I think my films should reflect how diverse America is and everyone should feel represented.“False and Baseless” is a drama with a female-forward narrative. This story is essential for our community to see and talk about. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                WRITER'S STATEMENT
            </h2>
            <p>
                My fascination with the crime movie genre is due to the intense feeling I get when I watch crime-based narratives. I wanted to write a screenplay that
                provides the same feelings. Then I saw a documentary about a serial rapist, and from the documentary, what bothered me the most is that a victim had to
                deal with harsh questioning from the police. I had that same uncomfortable feeling that I wanted for my film. I researched how often women deal with
                "secondary victimization" from testing about their rape. Unfortunately, it does happen more than people think. I believe my film presents a female voice
                that is fighting to be heard and believed. I want to empower women not to remain silent for the convenience of a flawed justice system. Talking about
                sexual assault is still stigmatized, and I hope this film changes that. 
            </p>
